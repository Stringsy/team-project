\chapter{Design}
\label{design}

This chapter covers the various aspects of the application's design process. As our project was client-based the design was very much focused on satisfying the requirements laid out in the previous chapter. Fiona Dowell, our client from Glasgow University's Veterinary school, evaluated our initial user interface design and we then revised ir according to the feedback that we received from her. 

\section{Design Goals and Objectives}
