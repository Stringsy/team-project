\section{Summary}

The aim of our project was to create a learning application for veterinary students that will allow them to learn and revise course content for learning about drug calculations in animals. After a full evaluation of our application with our client, Dr Fiona Dowell, and a group of students, we are satisfied that we met all product requirements. \\
A student user is able to successfully and easily view all the topics available, browse through all of the slides within each topic, answering questions as they go along, and they can complete a final assessment at the end to test how much they have learned.\\
An admin user can successfully manage all content for the application - including uploading new slides and questions, editing topics and questions and delete any topics, slides or questions.\\
