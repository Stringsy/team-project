\section{Abstract}
\section{Developing a Web Based Application }
One of the requirements for our project was that our final product should be available to 
use to any user with an Internet Connection. More specifically, any student should be 
able to access the application and practice on their drug calculations in their free time 
wherever they are with any device that can access the Web. This can be a laptop 
computer, a mobile phone or a tablet computer. \\ 
It was, therefore, clear to us that creating an application that needs to be installed on a 
machine in order to be usable was not an option. After a discussion with the team we 
decided that the most suitable solution would be to implement a application that would be 
accessible via a Web Browser. A web application would make it possible for any user to 
access our application from any device simply by navigating to our Web Applications 
URL address. \\ 

\subsection {Using a Web Application Framework}
After doing some research looking for the best possible option for developing web 
applications we decided that we would make use of a web development framework 
rather than writing the code for the whole application from scratch.
\subsubsection{ Developing from Scratch}
Developing an application from scratch has the potential to take up much needed time 
from the Development Phase. For each different page of an application there needs to be 
a unique file (for example an html document) that will be sent to the client's web browser 
when the page is called. An application usually has the same layout on every page with 
basic components, like the applications logo or the applications default buttons, being 
displayed on each page. It is therefore clear that having a separate file to correspond to 
each different page of an application can lead to a lot of coding overhead and 'boiler 
plate' code. In the case of a change request, a developer will need to modify the code in 
each different page separately which would take much of our development time. Time was a major concern for us as we only had a limited amount of time to get the application designed, developed, evaluated and delivered to our client.â€©\subsubsection{Developing with a web application framework}
