\section{Client Interview}

The project was proposed by Dr Fiona Dowell, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine. Initially, we met with Dr Fiona Dowell in order to gain more information about the requirements and specification for the application to ensure that we produced an application relevant to what the client wanted.\\
Our initial requirements for the vet application were :

\begin{itemize}
\item A learning application for vet students, providing step-by-step tutorials for different sections of the vet course.
\item Simple example questions within each topic to test how much the user is learning about that specific section.
\item A larger assessment at the end of all sections to test users on all the content within the application.
\end{itemize}

After the initial meeting with our client, we thought that it would be useful for the content within the application to be able to be updated , for example if the content changed; to fix errors or update to include different questions. We presented this idea to the client who agreed that this would be a useful feature as it might be good to be able to update after some user feedback. The functional requirements were then updated to include an administration system.\\
The administration system allows admin staff to upload and remove topics. It also allows the content of each topic to be updated, slides and questions can be added and removed.


\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Requirements Table}

\textbf{Student -} Uses the application to browse through the different topics, answering the sample questions as they go along and completing the assessment at the end of all topics.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline \textbf{ID} & \textbf{Non-functional Requirement}\\
\hline NFR1 & Availability\\
\hline NFR2 & Performance\\
\hline NFR3 & Educational\\
\hline NFR4 & Portability\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{ NFR1: Availability}\\
As our application is a web-based application, it is important that users are able to access the application at all times, provided that the server it is running on is working.

\textbf{NFR2: Performance}\\
Performance is an important part of the usability of our application. Our application should be able to load content from the database and display it within our application in a short amount of time. Failure to do so may result in the application being an inefficient and ineffective learning tool.\\

\textbf{ NFR3: Educational}\\
The application should be educational to users, whether it be new information or revising the material. Allowing the users to read through the slides and answer related questions should enhance the users knowledge.

\textbf{ NFR4 : Portability}\\
Having a web-based application means that our application is not restricted to a certain operating platform. This means that our application should be able to run on any platform without having to install additional software.
