\section{Investigation Of Existing Artifacts}

There are a few similar tools and learning resources available for vet students. This section discusses some of the current tools and a few tools which our client, Fiona Dowell, showed us in order to give us an idea of what she wanted for the application.

\subsection{NHS Adult Drug Calculations}

The NHS Adult Drug Calculations, a smartphone based learning tool, allows the user to browse through different topics. Within each topic, there are a few slides providing the user with the information and theory, and then has "Check your knowledge" slides containing multiple choice questions to test the user on what they have learned.

\subsection{Vet Calculator}
